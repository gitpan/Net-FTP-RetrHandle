0.2 Released 2006-09-27
=======================

* Fix bug with tell returning real position, not taking buffering into
  account.

* Seperate seek and sysseek, and move all buffer-related seek code
  into seek.

* seek will do nothing if it seeks to the same position it's already in.
  This is a common idiom for finding the current position, and anyways
  Archive::Zip does it a lot.  This makes a big performance difference
  with Archive::Zip over FTP.  

* Fix caching of current mode in binmode method.  This makes a big
  performance difference with Archive::Zip over FTP.
